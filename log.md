### Day 3: Jan 28 2022, Friday

**Today's Progress**
Today i decided to go back to the basics of JavaScript on freeCodeCamp in the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.

**Thoughts**
I didn't do much JavaScript when i was in Bootcamp and doing the Front End Development caught me off guard. So back to the basics it is.

## Day 4: Jan 30 2022, Sunday

**Today's Progress**
Completed basic JavaScript of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.

**Thoughts**
The last few chapters were challenging for me. I had to take a look at hints to understand what i'm supposed to do. Will come back to those chapters and redo it again.

Completed ES6 of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.

**Thoughts**
The exercises in the ES6 chapters weren't as confusing as Basic JavaScript. So i might have to go back to practicing Basic JavaScript later on.
