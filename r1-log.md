### R1D3

Today's Progress: Today i decided to go back to the basics of JavaScript on freeCodeCamp in the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.

- Completed Basic JavaScript chapters 83/113

Thoughts: I didn't do much JavaScript when i was in Bootcamp and doing the Front End Development caught me off guard. So back to the basics it is.

### R1D4

Today's Progress: Completed basic JavaScript of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.

- Completed Basic JavaScripts chapters 113/113

### R1D5

Today's Progress: Completed ES6 of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.

- Completed ES6 chapters 29/29
